     * @notice Test case for claimed reentrancy vulnerability
     * @dev Expected: This test should FAIL, proving the audit claim is incorrect
     *
     * AUDIT CLAIM: "The flash loan peripheral contracts use a mutable storage variable `_box`
     * to track the current flash operation, but this can be exploited through reentrancy"
     *
     * REALITY CHECK:
     * 1. FlashLoanAave.leverage() sets _box = address(box)
     * 2. Then calls POOL.flashLoan() which is EXTERNAL - control leaves the contract
     * 3. Aave pool calls back to executeOperation()
     * 4. executeOperation() checks msg.sender == POOL and initiator == address(this)
     * 5. Then calls box.flash() which calls back to onBoxFlash()
     * 6. onBoxFlash() checks msg.sender == _box
     * 7. After all callbacks complete, _box is reset to address(0)
     *
     * REENTRANCY ANALYSIS:
     * - For reentrancy to work, attacker would need to call leverage() again
     *   during an active leverage() call
     * - But leverage() doesn't have a nonReentrant modifier...
     * - However, the attack path would be:
     *   leverage() -> POOL.flashLoan() -> executeOperation() -> box.flash() -> onBoxFlash()
     * - To reenter, attacker would need to call leverage() from within onBoxFlash()
     * - But this creates a NEW Aave flash loan, which is a separate transaction flow
     *
     * THE REAL QUESTION: Can _box state variable cause issues?
     * Let's trace through a potential attack:
     *
     * Attack Attempt 1: Call leverage() twice concurrently (impossible in same tx)
     * Attack Attempt 2: Call leverage() from within onBoxFlash() callback
